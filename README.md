# Sign-Language-Detection-using-Deep-learning
This project focuses on detecting and recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) using deep learning techniques. We created a custom ISL dataset consisting of static images representing various signs. Our approach involves preprocessing these images, extracting meaningful features, and training deep learning models for accurate gesture recognition.
